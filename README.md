# Prim-s-MST-Algorithm
Consists of scalable C programs in order to run prims algorithm effeciently.

Final Project from Data Structures and Algorithims class at the University of Alabama.

Implements object-oriented practices using the C programming language. Uses scalable public classes with memory management practices.

To execute the program, first compile the program using the provided Makefile and then use the commandline comands ./prim yourInputFileHere

To ensure correct syntax when reading in your graph, read the instructions in the heading of prim.c
