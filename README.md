# Prims-MST-Algorithm

Final Project from Data Structures and Algorithms class at the University of Alabama.

Implements scalable, generic object-oriented classes with memory management practices to execute Prim's Algorithm in an O(ElogV) runtime complexity.

To execute the program, first compile the program using the provided Makefile and then use the commandline comands ./prim yourInputFileHere.

To ensure correct syntax when reading in your graph, read the instructions in the heading of the file "prim.c".
