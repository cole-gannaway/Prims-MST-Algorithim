# Prims-MST-Algorithm
Consists of scalable object-oriented C to run prims algorithm in O(ElogV).

Final Project from Data Structures and Algorithims class at the University of Alabama.

Implements object-oriented practices using the C programming language. Uses scalable public classes with memory management practices.

To execute the program, first compile the program using the provided Makefile and then use the commandline comands ./prim yourInputFileHere.

To ensure correct syntax when reading in your graph, read the instructions in the heading of the file "prim.c".
